Hello, I'm Austin Vazquez. I'm a software developer in Seattle, Washington primarily focused on container
runtimes at AWS. I wear many hats including son, brother, uncle, mentee, scientist, developer, mentor,
project manager (not my strongest role but I'm working on it), and maintainer just to name a few of my
favorites.

Like many my interest in containers started way back in 2015 as a Docker user. At the time, I was a co-op
student working at [Adtran](https://github.com/ADTRAN) and was fortunate enough to stumble upon a group of
developers/mentors with a vision for reachitecting developer experience at the company. I got to experience
first hand going from building monolithic proprietary OS-based products in a locked down virtual machine to
building microserviced debian flavored packages in containers. The difference was night and day, and I was
hooked to say the least.

Fast-forward almost 10 years later. I am now a maintainer of a couple of the components which made up the container runtime stack I had used to run my first container. i.e. moby engine and containerd.
